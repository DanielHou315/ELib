# ELib

ELib is a compilation of algorithms and controllers for 169E in the 2021-2022 full-stack navigation and controlling system. 
This is an ongoing effort to clean up and generate proper documentation for our wrappers and functions. Some wrappers and functions may NOT work in this dev repo.

# Configure Project
1. Replace file /include/okapi/api/odometry/point.hpp and /include/okapi/api/odometry/odomstate.hpp with the one in the ELib folder
-- this implementation adds ability to initialize a point
