# ELib

ELib is a compilation of algorithms and controllers for 169E in the 2021-2022 full-stack navigation and controlling system. 
This is an ongoing effort to clean up and generate proper documentation for our wrappers and functions. 

All functionalities have been tested by 169E in the 2022 VEX Tipping Point World Championship Robot (which didn't perform very well but was at least consistent programming wise). Proper formatting and documentation is still under way.
