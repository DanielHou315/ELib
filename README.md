# ELib

ELib is a compilation of algorithms and controllers for 169E in the 2021-2022 full-stack navigation and control framework based on PROS by Purdue Sigbots. Thiere is an ongoing (although intermittent) effort to clean up and generate proper documentation for these wrappers and functions. 

All functionalities have been tested by 169E in the 2022 VEX Tipping Point World Championship Robot (which didn't win all the time but was very consistent in program performance and reliability for that matter). This repo is still in need of cleaning up and more algorithm implementations may be added in the future.
